          <p>   In the traditional mandi system, farmers generally procure very less price for their crops as they has to pass through various intermediaries at the physical marketplace. This not only adds costs but also handling costs.<br>

              In addition, the famer has to face obstacles in form of multiple tax levies and licenses and weak logistics and infrastructure in India.
<br>
With introduction of NAM transparency will be introduced in the marketing system, and market will be regulated. It will enable participation and benefits for the entire agri value chain, from farmer to consumer. There will be creation of high-end warehouses just near to production clusters.
<br>
The proposed NAM framework envisages real-time electronic auctioning of the commodities along with integrated assaying, weighing, storage and payment systems. It proposes to issue a single licence for trading across the country. Also, the payments will be credited directly to the farmersâ€™ accounts.
<br>
Details will be furnished on the electronic platform. It will provide a dual benefit to producers by averting the need to bring produce to the market physically and enabling them to avail funding against the commodities stored in the warehouses, thus strengthening the price risk management framework for the farmer.</p>
